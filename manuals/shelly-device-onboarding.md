# Shelly device onboarding

1. Connect to the wifi prefixed with `Shelly`
2. Enter the ip `192.168.33.1` in your browser
3. Setup the device to connect to the `berg-iot` network
4. Look for the device in the unifi clients. `berg-iot` devices get isolated in a specific network in the subnet 192.168.2.X
5. Pin the IP for the new device (use a static ip)
6. Enter the device to the inventory located in `inventory/inventory.json`
